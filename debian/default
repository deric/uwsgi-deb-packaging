# At startup VERBOSE value is setted in 'no'. So when user invokes
# uWSGI init.d script, no output is showed.
# It could be unexpected behaviour, because it is common practice for
# init.d script to ignore VERBOSE value.
# Here VERBOSE is overriden to conform such the practice.

# Should init.d script print configuration file names while marking progress of
# it's execution?
#
# If 'no', then init.d script prints one-character symbols instead file names.
#
# Printing confnames is quite informative, but could mess terminal output or
# be somewhat dangerous (as filename could contain arbitary characters).
# ASCII control characters in file names are replaced with '?' in init.d script
# output, nevertheless you were warned.

# init.d script starts instance of uWSGI daemon for each found user-created
# configuration file.
#
# Options from inherited configuration file are passed to each instance by
# default. They could be overrided (or extended) by user configuration file.
